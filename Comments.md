SUMMARY: 

The client server pulls information from a database at the command of a GET request. 

The front-end javascript code successfully calls information from a client server and presents it to HTML page.

This information is presented neatly in array format with a randomized fact generator corresponding to the search list.


THINGS WE THOUGHT WERE COOL:

1. The front end looks really nice! The CSS is clean and neat reminiscent of a 2018 google format.

2. The organisation of your client and server side is very neat and easy to follow, your set-up instructions were a nice touch.

3. The use of comments on your scripts effectively conveys your methods and makes the code easier to follow. 

4. The code itself is neatly formatted and easy to read.

THINGS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE:

1. A nice addition would have been a way to bring up another page for the search results (admittedly we couldn't get this to work for ours)

2. A more neatly formatted display for the search results to match the nice format of the google page. 

3. A nice touch would have also been the use of website links for the search results instead of facts to add to the theme of a search page.
